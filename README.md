# Yape Mobile iOS Challenge - Recipes

## Challenge Instructions:
Build an app with three screens: 
Home, Details and Map that allows the user to filter on a list and see details.

This App consumes an api created using [mock api.io](https://mockapi.io/). 

It is aimed to expose a good understaing of clean code, 
strong knowledge of Swift and SOLID principles.
It is been made upon VIPER Architecture pattern, that has one main reason:
Separation of concerns, it clearly defines the responsibilities of each component 
and separates the user interface, business logic, and data model into distinct layers,
resulting in a more scalable and testable code.

**Features:**
- List of Recipes and search bar by Ingredients and name
- Detail of recipes
- Origin on map, and map app

## Dessign Patterns
- Delegates: As decided to build the app with UIKit and Storyboard.

## Tech stack - Library:
- Swift
- [Kingfisher](https://swiftpackageindex.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/master/documentation/kingfisher)
This library allows to download and cache images from the web, making UI scalable and faster.
